_\*Note on Recall Lore: when you take your first rank in this skill, you choose two subskills to be trained in. If a class or feature grants you a specific subskill, like Recall Occult Lore, you pick that and one other of your choice. Whenever you get another rank, you pick one additional subskill. Your rank in this skill applies to all subskills._
