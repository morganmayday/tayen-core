-- Manipulate
- Subtle nudges, lower power ceiling, also can work as team inspiration
- morgan note: cool fucking concept here that may not work but can be tabbed: a sort of emotional parallelisation thing.

-- Command
- Much more powerful than Manipulate but much more brazen and visible, also very very illegal
- Compulsions, dominations

-- Exert Will
- Maybe some sort of metamagic or countermagic? Messing with spells, either yours or others?
- morgan note: yah sounds right
