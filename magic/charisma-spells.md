#### Manipulate
- Subtle nudges, lower power ceiling, also can work as team inspiration
- morgan note: cool fucking concept here that may not work but can be tabbed: a sort of emotional parallelisation thing.

Soapy Draft

IV: smth smth you invest a paragraph of text with revery magic that compels whoever reads it to carry out an order, which you choose when writing the text.

#### Command
- Much more powerful than Manipulate but much more brazen and visible, also very very illegal
- Compulsions, dominations

Soapy Draft

Major action, varies, vs Exert Will, revery

I: The target takes an action of your choice on their next turn. Must speak the command aloud, and the action must be a listed major or minor action. [? I dont want to pigeonhole it but it _is_ really powerful]

II:  As above, but the command holds for a minute. [i.e. "surrender"]

III: As above, but with one of the following:
- Can add extra targets for +2 spin each, 8 targets or more becomes "everyone within earshot".
- The command holds for [an hour/8 hours/a day? idk].
- You do not need to speak the command aloud. [manipulate territory]

IV: You issue an order [idk. much more irresistible?]

#### Exert Will
Varies, 60ft, instant, vs Exert Will, 1 spin + 2 per rank, fulcry

I: The next spell you cast this scene has a +2 focus bonus on its related check. Minor action.

II: Choose a spell or magical effect within range and roll Exert Will vs its caster, or, if unattended, its set DC. If you win the contest, you end the spell or magical effect. Otherwise, you learn the exact details of the spell or magical effect. Major action.

III: The next spell you cast this scene either has +30ft range, reduces the cast time from fullround to major, major to minor, or minor to free.

IV: As II, except you get a +2 focus bonus on the Exert Will check, and if you succeed, you can either end the spell or magical effect, _or_ end it and cast it yourself as a free action immediately, spending resources as appropriate.
