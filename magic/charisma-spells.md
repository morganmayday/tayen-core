-- Manipulate
- Subtle nudges, lower power ceiling, also can work as team inspiration
- morgan note: cool fucking concept here that may not work but can be tabbed: a sort of emotional parallelisation thing.

Soapy Draft

IV: smth smth you invest a paragraph of text with revery magic that compels whoever reads it to carry out an order, which you choose when writing the text.

-- Command (Compel)
- Much more powerful than Manipulate but much more brazen and visible, also very very illegal
- Compulsions, dominations

Major Action, Varies, Vs Exert Will

I: The target takes an action of your choice on their next turn. Must speak the command aloud.

II:  As above, but the command holds for a minute. [i.e. "surrender"]

III: As above, but with one of the following:
- Can add extra targets for +2 spin each, 8 targets or more becomes "everyone within earshot".
- The command holds for [an hour/8 hours/a day? idk].
- You do not need to speak the command aloud.

IV: Thirteen round casting time, where you and the target maintain contact, and an oath is sworn. The target will never break the oath, and will interpret it in fairly good faith. [Needs penalties. also maybe stipulation for failure despite trying hardest]

-- Exert Will
- Maybe some sort of metamagic or countermagic? Messing with spells, either yours or others?
- morgan note: yah sounds right
