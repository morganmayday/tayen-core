#### Manipulate
- Subtle nudges, lower power ceiling, also can work as team inspiration
- morgan note: cool fucking concept here that may not work but can be tabbed: a sort of emotional parallelisation thing.

Soapy Draft

IV: smth smth you invest a paragraph of text with revery magic that compels whoever reads it to carry out an order, which you choose when writing the text.

#### Command
- Much more powerful than Manipulate but much more brazen and visible, also very very illegal
- Compulsions, dominations

Soapy Draft

Major action, varies, vs Exert Will, revery

I: The target takes an action of your choice on their next turn. Must speak the command aloud, and the action must be a listed major or minor action. [? I dont want to pigeonhole it but it _is_ really powerful]

II:  As above, but the command holds for a minute. [i.e. "surrender"]

III: As above, but with one of the following:
- Can add extra targets for +2 spin each, 8 targets or more becomes "everyone within earshot".
- The command holds for [an hour/8 hours/a day? idk].
- You do not need to speak the command aloud. [manipulate territory]

IV: You issue an order [idk. much more irresistible?]

#### Exert Will
- Maybe some sort of metamagic or countermagic? Messing with spells, either yours or others?
- morgan note: yah sounds right
