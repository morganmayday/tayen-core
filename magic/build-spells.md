-- Endure
- Simplest option is some kind of shield/dr

### Dexterity Skills
-- Strike First
- Lower damage, maybe minor action, maybe higher tiers have some sort of debuffs on-hit?
- - no scaling damage, and often ranged (thought: higher levels of the spell have higher min range. II hits 10-30, IV hits 30-90, whatever)

-- Be Precise
- Buff to dexterity checks for the duration, used for crafting (fabricate) or combat

-- Evade
- Get much better at dodging
- useful also in social combat, the defensive option to read someone's offense

### Intuition Skills
-- Ear to the Ground
- Maybe some sort of city sense/"talk to vermin and get the scoop", at higher tiers fully just connecting to the dream of the area and asking it shit
- Divination also works

-- Read Someone
- Find weaknesses in opponents, especially in social settings. Single target, instead of Evade's more general dodge

-- Track Down
- Scry!

### Knowledge Skills
-- Recall Lore
- Indexing in some regard? Maybe if you have not heard of a thing it tells you someone or somewhere that might have the information

-- Finagle
- Unsure. Maybe "bend laws of reality so a thing works that shouldn't"?
- Funny idea: called shot. You name a certain condition, and if you fulfil it, you get big payoff

-- Research
- Some sort of "pick a guy that knows stuff" summon ritual
- Maybe this could work as divination, you can pick someone with some knowledge of the future

### Charisma Skills
-- Manipulate
- Subtle nudges, lower power ceiling, also can work as team inspiration

-- Command
- Much more powerful than Manipulate but much more brazen and visible

-- Exert Will
- Maybe some sort of metamagic or countermagic? Messing with spells, either yours or others?
