#### Read Someone
- Find weaknesses in opponents, especially in social settings. Single target, instead of Evade's more general dodge
- morgan note: not Detect Thoughts, but perhaps like. an impulse foresight

- Ask the spinner the next intended skill-roll of a character
- funny atium clashing if you both use it idk that doesn't need saying

Soapy Draff

I: [Low spin minor or free action] Ask the Spinner what skill a target of choice is intending to next roll.

II: [Fair spin minor action] As above. You can also ask on each of your next four turns, on the same target.

III: [High spin] As above. When you hear the answer, pick a skill of yours to get a +3 [5?] Circumstance bonus on contests with the target.

IV: [Major] You draw on a jalison such as Secrets Yet Unknown, who whispers a deep dark secret of theirs to you. You must make eye contact with the target.

#### Track Down

1 minute, variable, instant, vs Exert Will, 8 spin

I: Target an entity you have a physical piece of--hair, fingernails, skin, blood, bone, et cetera. If they aren't within 1000 feet of you as you complete the spell, you simply learn what direction they're in, no contest. If they're within range, instead you learn the direction and then get a glimpse of what they're doing right now if you win the contest. They aren't aware of the contest or scrying. If they're in another dream, the scrying fails.

II: As I, but you don't need a physical piece of them, the range is extended to 1 mile, and you get a +4 bonus to the contest if you have the piece of them.

III: As II, but the range is unlimited within the same dream as them, and if they aren't within the same dream as you, you learn where the nearest dreamcrossing to get you closer to them is.

IV: As III, but the range is unlimited, can cross intersomnial boundaries, and if they lose the contest, you can expend 2 spin to get a glimpse again on your next turn, as many times as you'd like, no contest.
