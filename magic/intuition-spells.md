-- Ear to the Ground
- Maybe some sort of city sense/"talk to vermin and get the scoop", at higher tiers fully just connecting to the dream of the area and asking it shit
- Divination also works

-- Read Someone

__Scry (Track Down)__

1 minute, variable, variable, vs Exert Will, 8 spin

I: Target an entity you have a physical piece of--hair, fingernails, skin, blood, bone, et cetera. If they aren't within 1000 feet of you as you complete the spell, you simply learn what direction they're in, no contest. If they're within range, instead you learn the direction and then get a glimpse of what they're doing right now if you win the contest. They aren't aware of the contest or scrying.
