#### Read Someone
Major action, 30ft, scene, vs Manipulate, 1 spin + 3 per rank, revery

[I: You scry the next action of your target. If they succeed on the contest, you simply know what skill they're planning on using next. If you succeed or the contest is tied, you know what action they're planning on taking next. This doesn't guarantee that they'll take it, 

II: [Fair spin minor action] As above. You can also ask on each of your next four turns, on the same target.] I don't reallly like these mechanically

III: [High spin] As above. When you hear the answer, pick a skill of yours to get a +3 [5?] Circumstance bonus on contests with the target.

IV: [Major] You draw on a jalison such as Secrets Yet Unknown, who whispers a deep dark secret of theirs to you. You must make eye contact with the target.

#### Track Down

1 minute, variable, instant, vs Exert Will, 8 spin

I: Target an entity you have a physical piece of--hair, fingernails, skin, blood, bone, et cetera. If they aren't within 1000 feet of you as you complete the spell, you simply learn what direction they're in, no contest. If they're within range, instead you learn the direction and then get a glimpse of what they're doing right now if you win the contest. They aren't aware of the contest or scrying. If they're in another dream, the scrying fails.

II: As I, but you don't need a physical piece of them, the range is extended to 1 mile, and you get a +4 bonus to the contest if you have the piece of them.

III: As II, but the range is unlimited within the same dream as them, and if they aren't within the same dream as you, you learn where the nearest dreamcrossing to get you closer to them is.

IV: As III, but the range is unlimited, can cross intersomnial boundaries, and if they lose the contest, you can expend 2 spin to get a glimpse again on your next turn, as many times as you'd like, no contest.
