__Augury (Ear to the Ground)__
1 minute, self, instant, N/A, 6 spin

I: You may ask the Spinner one of the following questions.

tbd

-- Read Someone
- Find weaknesses in opponents, especially in social settings. Single target, instead of Evade's more general dodge

__Scry (Track Down)__

1 minute, variable, variable, vs Exert Will, 8 spin

I: Target an entity you have a physical piece of--hair, fingernails, skin, blood, bone, et cetera. If they aren't within 1000 feet of you as you complete the spell, you simply learn what direction they're in, no contest. If they're within range, instead you learn the direction and then get a glimpse of what they're doing right now if you win the contest. They aren't aware of the contest or scrying. If they're in another dream, the scrying fails.

II: As I, but you don't need a physical piece of them, the range is extended to 1 mile, and you get a +4 bonus to the contest if you have the piece of them.

III: As II, but the range is unlimited within the same dream as them, and if they aren't within the same dream as you, you learn where the nearest dreamcrossing to get you closer to them is.

IV: As III, but the range is unlimited, can cross intersomnial boundaries, and if they lose the contest, you can expend 2 spin to get a glimpse again on your next turn, as many times as you'd like, no contest.
