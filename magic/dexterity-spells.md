__Be Precise?__

- Buff to dexterity checks for the duration?
- morgan note: this would be the perfect place for any like Arcane Hand thingies
- luke note: tbh this feels like drone-strike and telepathy stuff?? like in the form of you shoot something and you can a) make it homing or b) manually control it

Soapy Draft [spin and actions and shit to work out]

I: You can telekinetically move one object at a time within 30ft for [duration]. All checks with this have a -3 [5?] penalty.

II: You mentally convey a silent message to a person within earshot, they may respond briefly.

III: As I, but no penalty and you can choose to receive fine sensation back from whatever you are handling.

IV: You and any number of people within earshot (chosen upon cast) can communicate silently for [duration]. This spell ends for any person that leaves the range.

__Evade?__
- Get much better at dodging
- useful also in social combat, the defensive option to read someone's offense

- something along the lines of "pick a skill. enemies have X circumstance penalty when using it on you and/or you have a bonus to the opposing check". You can do it to hit hard, strike first, read someone, manipulate...
