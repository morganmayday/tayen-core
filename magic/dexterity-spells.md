__Be Precise?__

- Buff to dexterity checks for the duration?
- morgan note: this would be the perfect place for any like Arcane Hand thingies
- luke note: tbh this feels like drone-strike and telepathy stuff?? like in the form of you shoot something and you can a) make it homing or b) manually control it

__Evade?__
- Get much better at dodging
- useful also in social combat, the defensive option to read someone's offense
