__NameTBD (Be Precise)__

Free action, 30ft, variable, N/A, 4 spin, rectory (I/III)/revery (II/IV)

I: You can telekinetically move one object at a time within range for the scene, or until your concentration is broken. All checks with this have a -3 penalty, and take the same actions as they would if you were physically performing them. Cast this only at the start of your turn.

II: You mentally convey a silent message or mental image to a willing target within range.

III: As I, but no penalty, and you can choose to receive fine sensation back from whatever you are handling.

IV: You and any number of willing targets within range (chosen upon cast) can communicate silently for the scene in mental images and messages, as II. This spell ends for any target that goes more than 30ft away from you, and ends if you dismiss it or your concentration is broken. Cast this only at the start of your turn.

__Evade?__
- Get much better at dodging
- useful also in social combat, the defensive option to read someone's offense

- something along the lines of "pick a skill. enemies have X circumstance penalty when using it on you and/or you have a bonus to the opposing check". You can do it to hit hard, strike first, read someone, manipulate...
