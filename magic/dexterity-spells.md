__Be Precise?__

- Buff to dexterity checks for the duration?
- morgan note: this would be the perfect place for any like Arcane Hand thingies
- luke note: tbh this feels like drone-strike and telepathy stuff?? like in the form of you shoot something and you can a) make it homing or b) manually control it

__Evade?__
- Get much better at dodging
- useful also in social combat, the defensive option to read someone's offense

- something along the lines of "pick a skill. enemies have X circumstance penalty when using it on you and/or you have a bonus to the opposing check". You can do it to hit hard, strike first, read someone, manipulate...
