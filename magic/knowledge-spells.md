-- Recall Lore
- Indexing in some regard? Maybe if you have not heard of a thing it tells you someone or somewhere that might have the information

-- Finagle
- Unsure. Maybe "bend laws of reality so a thing works that shouldn't"?
- Funny idea: called shot. You name a certain condition, and if you fulfil it, you get big payoff
- morgan note: if any skill should be Fabricatey it should be this one

-- Research
- Some sort of "pick a guy that knows stuff" summon ritual
- Maybe this could work as divination, you can pick someone with some knowledge of the future
- morgan note: a la Legend Lore perhaps
