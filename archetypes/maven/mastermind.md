#### Cunning Insight
A first-level mastermind that _reads intent_ can spend a Cunning Die to ask an additional question, either from the stock list or the following below questions.

-- What would I have to offer them to do what I want?

-- Are their convictions stronger than mine?

#### Aid Allies
A first-level mastermind can help their allies succeed more effectively. They can use Read Someone to _help_ in skills they aren't trained in; since Read Someone is a primary skill for them, they will always be able to _help._

#### Backup Plan
A second-level mastermind begins to think about contingencies. When shit hits the fan, they can roll Plot, with a +1 grit bonus for each Grit they're missing.

On a 12 or higher, the mastermind tells the Spinner about their contingency plan, and the Spinner tells them what's different here that they didn't forsee.

On a 15 or higher, the mastermind tells the Spinner about their contingency plan, and the Spinner tells them what they could change to be more likely to make it out in one piece. This doesn't guarantee success.

On an 18 or higher, the mastermind tells the Spinner about their contingency plan, and the Spinner tells them something about the situation that will let them pull it off. This doesn't guarantee success.

#### Plot Ahead
A third-level mastermind can't see the future, but that doesn't mean they don't try. At the start of any conflict, they can list off the participants they know about, then ask the Spinner two of the following questions.

-- Are there any players I haven't noticed in this conflict?

-- Which player is most dangerous to me personally in this conflict?

-- Which player is most dangerous to my goals in this conflict?

-- What is this player going to try to do in this conflict?

-- If I [engage in/disengage from] this conflict, what would the immediate effects of that be?
