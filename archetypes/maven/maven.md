### The Maven

> fluff here

The Maven has *three* Action Dice and *three* Cunning Dice, which are *d6,* gaining one of each at each odd-numbered level. Their Grit Die is a *d8* and their Stress Die is a *d6*. Their Health per level is 8 + Build.

A Maven of third level or higher is locally acclaimed as an expert in their field, and will be sought out as a source of knowledge by locals. A Maven of fifth level or higher has reached international acclaim; while they aren't a household name, anyone who knows anything about their field will know of them. A Maven of seventh level or higher has reached intersomnial acclaim, often through something in their field named after them; the most famous example includes Ev Belmar and the polymerized coating known as _belmarite._

The three Maven archetypes are [Mastermind](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/maven/mastermind.md), [Sharp](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/maven/sharp.md), and [Warden](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/maven/warden.md).

| Level | Abilities |
| ----- | --------- |
| 2 | Adapt |
| 5 | tbd |
| 8 | tbd |

#### Adapt
A second-level maven that fails a check can cash in a Cunning Die, to allow them to spend an ability that isn't linked to the check to reroll.
