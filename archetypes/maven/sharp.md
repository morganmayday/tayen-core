### The Sharp

> fluff text here

The sharp's key ability is Knowledge. Their primary skills are Finagle and Be Precise, and they are trained in Recall Arcane Lore and Research.

#### Cunning Improvisation
A first-level sharp that rolls _any_ skill check can spend a Cunning Die to apply their Finagle bonus to it, instead of their usual bonus. They can only do this before they roll.

Design Notes

I want the Sharp to be kind of. The vibe of "I'll find weird solutions to weird problems". This makes it kind of an inherently problem class but also I love it too much rn
