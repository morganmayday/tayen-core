### The Sharp

> fluff text here

The sharp's key ability is Knowledge. Their primary skills are Finagle and Be Precise, and they receive a rank in Recall Arcane Lore and Research.

#### Cunning Improvisation
A first-level sharp that rolls _any_ skill check can spend a Cunning Die to apply their Finagle bonus to it, instead of their usual bonus. They can only do this before they roll.

#### Mix It Up
A first-level sharp does not have access to spin dice, but can still cast spells like arcanists can. They choose two skills they have one or more ranks in, as well as Finagle, to have access to spells from.

They do not have Spin Dice, but can convert a Cunning Die to spin equal to its value during the casting of a spell. They don't keep any excess, and can only do this with one die before they rest.

#### Focus Up
A second-level sharp, when shit hits the fan, can ask the Spinner

Design Notes

I want the Sharp to be kind of. The vibe of "I'll find weird solutions to weird problems". This makes it kind of an inherently problem class but also I love it too much rn
