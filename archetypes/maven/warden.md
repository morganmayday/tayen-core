#### Cunning Lore
A first-level warden that makes any Recall Lore check to _recall_ lore about a target can spend a Cunning Die to _recall_ one additional piece of lore, regardless of whether they succeed or fail on the check.

#### Hold Shut the Gate
A first-level warden in conflict scale can attempt to _forbid_ intelligent creatures from crossing thresholds willingly. They must share a language, or otherwise be able to make themselves understood to each other.

The warden begins a call-and-response with a creature as a major action, setting aside a Cunning Die. They must tell the creature a new reason it cannot cross the threshold each turn, then tick down their Cunning Die if the creature responds with a counter-reason. The counter-reason must be sensibly related to the reason the warden gives, but it can be repeated if it still applies. The creature cannot cross the threshold willingly while the die remains. 

A creature can still attempt to affect the warden, force them to stop speaking, or similar, but the warden receives a bonus on all instigated contests equal to the Cunning Die's number.

#### Intuit
A second-level warden gets a +1 grit bonus on all Recall Lore checks to _intuit information_ per Grit they're missing.

#### Dream Step
A third-level warden can, by concentrating for one minute, locate the nearest dreamcrossing by direction and distance, and can ask one of the following questions. They can hold their question until they attempt to activate the dreamcrossing.

-- How do I activate the dreamcrossing?

-- What can I expect on the other side?

-- Where does it ultimately lead?

#### Go Between
A third-level warden has a measure of arcanopolitical protection. While they may not be a member of an organization, they give off a _vibe,_ for lack of a better term--anyone two or more levels below them will not fuck with them, as the otherworldly forces they have touched have touched them back. They also get a +2 presence bonus to Command. 

Otherworldly creatures will also avoid harming a warden, unless they're certain they can get away with it.

#### Call a Conspirator
A fourth-level warden in event scale can, as a major action and expending 50ma of mystic reagents, can call upon one of the jasilon of knowledge and ask them three questions, which the jasilon must answer truthfully. The entire conversation from start to finish is permanently embedded in the wardenâ€™s memory. However, most jasilon resent being bound this way, and if the warden does not offer some form of payment for services rendered, may omit certain information or reveal an unwelcome truth.

A warden will call the same jasilon every time they use this feature, unless they research and call a different one. Maintaining a working relationship with their jasilon will likely make life easier for them.
