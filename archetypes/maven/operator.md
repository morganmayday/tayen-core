#### Cunning Adaptation
A first-level operator can, when they fail any skill check, spend a Cunning Die to change _one_ of the skills one of their tools affects. This lasts until they next take a rest, and doesn't affect the roll.\
> note: You can only change your tool if you can justify the _item_ being able to do the new skill--for example, a switchblade could reasonably Command, Strike First, Hit Hard, and probably other things, but it's unlikely to help with Recall Lore.

Additionally, as a full-round action in conflict scale, a minor action in event scale, or a free action at start of their turn in intrigue scale, they can _permanently_ change one of those skills, or swap out the tool entirely.

#### Source
A first-level operator can, as a free action, tell the Spinner they're looking to obtain something. They detail _either_ what they want that item to do, what they want it for, or what specifically it is, and roll Research.
The Spinner tells them _you could get your hands on it, but,_ and chooses up to two. On a 15 or higher, they choose up to one instead. 

-- You'll need to ally with someone you find unpleasant.\
-- You'll need to pay up.\
-- You'll owe someone.\
-- You'll make an enemy or alienate an ally.

The amount of effort it takes to get your hands on it is up to the Spinner. It has to be possible, but _possible_ doesn't mean _easy._

#### Make Use Of
A second-level operator, while missing half or more of their Grit, receives a +1 grit bonus to any checks they're already getting a tool bonus on. While they're missing all of their grit, this increases to a +2.
