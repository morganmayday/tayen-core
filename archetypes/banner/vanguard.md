#### Lead Allies

#### Lead the Attack
A first-level vanguard that initiates a conflict grants themself and all allies a +2 bonus on the first check they make this conflict.

#### Draw Fire
A second-level vanguard can, as a free action at the start of their turn, roll an Action Die and choose up to that many enemies that can see them. Those enemies get a +2 bonus to any checks targeting the vanguard this turn. If the vanguard only targets one enemy, that enemy must make an Exert Will check (DC 12 + the Action Die's result + twice the vanguard's level) any time they attempt to do something that doesn't target the vanguard this turn or lose the action.

#### Target Acquisition
A third-level vanguard, when shit hits the fan, can immediately ask the Spinner the following free question.

-- What is the priority target that is most vulnerable to me?

#### Break Their Line
A fourth-level vanguard that reduces an enemy to 0 Grit, Conviction, or Health can immediately, as a free action, attack any number of enemies that can see or hear them using Command, opposed by Exert Will. They can only do this once per Rest.
