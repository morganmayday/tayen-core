#### Lead Allies
A first-level vanguard that takes the Move conflict action can spend an allows up to one ally to move right behind them.

#### Lead the Attack
A first-level vanguard that initiates a conflict grants themself and all allies a +2 bonus on the first check they make this conflict.

#### Draw Fire
A second-level vanguard can, as a free action at the start of their turn, roll an Action Die and choose up to that many enemies that can see them. Those enemies get a +2 bonus to any checks targeting the vanguard this turn. If the vanguard only targets one enemy, that enemy must make an Exert Will check (DC 12 + the Action Die's result + twice the vanguard's level) any time they attempt to do something that doesn't target the vanguard this turn or lose the action.

#### Break Their Line
A third-level vanguard that reduces an enemy to 0 Grit, Conviction, or Health can immediately, as a free action, attack all enemies that can see or hear them using Command, opposed by Exert Will. They can only do this once per Rest.
