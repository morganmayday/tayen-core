Lead Allies
First level vanguard can cash in action die to offer some kind of defensive bonus to everyone in a certain radius?

Clear The Way
vanguard goes ahead of allies, providing some kind of bonus to anyone who has to perform the same roll after they do

there's an item in a game i play called "vanguard's banner" with the description "those in the front know who their lives are for" and i *almost* had a vibe about it but i lost what i was thinking of :/
