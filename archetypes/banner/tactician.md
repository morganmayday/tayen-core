### The Tactician

> fluff text here

The tactician's key ability is Intuition. Their primary skills are Command and Read Someone, and they receive a rank in Recall Historical Lore and Hit Hard.

| 1 | Command Allies, Tactical Judgement |

| 3 | Make the Call |

#### Command Allies
A first-level tactician that cashes in an Action Die for an extra action can instead grant that extra action to an ally that can see and hear them.

#### Tactical Judgement
A first-level tactician, when shit hits the fan, can immediately roll Read Someone and ask the Spinner a question. On a 12+, they may ask an additional question. On a 15+, they may ask two additional questions instead.

-- Which of my allies is in greatest danger here?

-- What is my allies' biggest strategic weakness to address?

-- What is my enemies' most immediate goal?

-- What outcomes of this conflict do my enemies most want?

#### Make the Call
A third-level tactician can, as a free action once per arc, if shit's already hit the fan this scene, tell the Spinner what their objective this scene is.

While the tactician pursues that goal, they receive a +2 confidence bonus this scene on _all_ checks to pursue it. If the goal is thwarted, though, they _immediately_ lose 4 Grit and take 2 Stress.

Strategic Play: tbh idk what this'd *be* but it's a vibe for an ability name
