#### Command Allies
A first-level tactician that cashes in an Action Die for an extra action can instead grant that extra action to an ally that can see and hear them.

#### Tactical Judgement
A first-level tactician, when shit hits the fan, can immediately roll Read Someone and ask the Spinner a question. On a 12+, they may ask an additional question. On a 16+, they may ask two additional questions instead.

-- Which of my allies is in greatest danger here?

-- What is my allies' biggest strategic weakness to address?

-- What is my enemies' most immediate goal?

-- What outcomes of this conflict do my enemies most want?
