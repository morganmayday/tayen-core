#### Command Allies
A first-level tactician that cashes in an Action Die for an extra action can instead grant that extra action to an ally that can see and hear them.

#### Tactical Judgement
A first-level tactician, when shit hits the fan, can immediately roll Plot and ask the Spinner a question. On a 12+, they may ask an additional question. On a 15+, they may ask two additional questions instead.

-- Which of my allies is in greatest danger here?

-- What is my allies' biggest strategic weakness to address?

-- What is my enemies' most immediate goal?

-- What outcomes of this conflict do my enemies most want?

#### Issue Orders
A second-level tactician can, at the start of their turn in any timescale, expend an Action Die and roll Command, choosing an ally they can communicate with. They direct the ally in a course of action, which they take on their turn.

The ally receives a +2 help bonus on the check, as if the tactician had _helped._ On a 15+, the ally receives a +2 morale bonus as well. 

#### Make the Call
A third-level tactician can, as a free action once per arc, if shit's already hit the fan this scene, tell the Spinner what their objective this scene is.

While the tactician pursues that goal, they receive a +2 confidence bonus this scene on _all_ checks to pursue it. If the goal is thwarted, though, they _immediately_ lose 4 Grit and take 2 Stress.

#### Formation
A fourth-level tactician, when shit hits the fan, can reposition all their allies in the scene as they choose as a free action, except themself and any allies in melee.
