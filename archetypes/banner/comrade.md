#### Assure Allies
A first-level comrade can shore up their allies' convictions. When an ally that can see and hear the comrade fails an Exert Will check or other check to avoid Conviction damage, the comrade can roll an Action Die to let them reroll, with that Action Die's result as a morale bonus.

#### Reassure Allies
A first-level comrade can assist an ally in recovery during a Rest. As a minor action, the comrade grants medical aid for the purposes of recovering Conviction and Health.

#### Take the Brunt
A second-level comrade, when an ally near them fails an Endure, Evade, or Exert Will check and the comrade succeeds, can spend an Action Die to choose to fail in the ally's stead.

#### Keep an Eye Out
A third-level comrade that _reads intent_ or _reads a situation_ can additionally ask the question, for free:

-- Which, if any, of my allies do they intend to hurt [first/next]?

#### Bastion
A fourth-level comrade, when shit hits the fan, gains _extra grit_, 2 for each enemy in the scene. This can go above their usual maximum, but any excess is lost when the scene ends.
