### The Banner

> fluff here

The Banner has *six* Action Dice, which are *d6,* gaining one at each level. Their Grit Die is a *d10* and their Stress Die is a *d8*. Their Health per level is 10 + Build.

A Banner of third level or higher is locally famous or infamous, and if unaffiliated, will often be sought out by potential liege-lords as a talented subordinate. A Banner of fifth level or higher has reached international acclaim; depending on how open their exploits are, they may be a household name. If they don't have a liegelord by now, they may be considered a political threat. A Banner of seventh level or higher often no longer has a liegelord; often, they are either living in silent retirement or have become a liegelord to others, most famously in the cases of Carmine Vehra and Aris Lustre.

The three Banner archetypes are Comrade, Tactician, and Vanguard.
