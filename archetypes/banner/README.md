### The Banner

> fluff here

The Banner has *six* Action Dice, which are *d6,* gaining one at each level. Their Grit Die is a *d10* and their Stress Die is a *d8*. Their Health is 12 + twice their level.

A Banner of third level or higher is locally famous or infamous, and if unaffiliated, will often be sought out by potential liege-lords as a talented subordinate. A Banner of fifth level or higher has reached international acclaim; depending on how open their exploits are, they may be a household name. If they don't have a liegelord by now, they may be considered a political threat. A Banner of seventh level or higher often no longer has a liegelord; often, they are either living in silent retirement or have become a liegelord to others, most famously in the cases of Carmen Vehra and Aris Lustre.

The three Banner archetypes are [Comrade](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/banner/comrade.md), [Tactician](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/banner/tactician.md), and [Vanguard](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/banner/vanguard.md).

#### Rally
The banner can expend Action Dice as any class can, but can also use them in other ways.

-- Roll an Action Die as a free action on a successful check to _inspire_ allies performing the same check in succession, giving the die's result as a morale bonus to their allies' checks.

-- Roll an Action Die as a free action when an enemy fails a check to _inspirit_ allies targeting that enemy this scene, giving the die's result as a morale bonus to their allies' checks.
