### The Arcanist

> fluff here

The Arcanist has *three* Action Dice and *four* Spin Dice, which are *d6,* gaining one Spin Die at each odd-numbered level. Their Grit Die is a *d6* and their Stress Die is a *d10*. Their Health is 6 + Build + twice their level.

An Arcanist of third level or higher is qualified for the in-universe title of Arcanist, and is often contacted by an organization such as the Gilded Tower with an offer of membership. An Arcanist of fifth level or higher has reached international acclaim; while they aren't a household name, anyone who knows anything about their specialties will know of them. An Arcanist of seventh level or higher has reached intersomnial acclaim, and is qualified for a Master's seat at the Gilded Tower if one is available; the most famous examples include Lyra Inkfingers and the konawen Sidhean.

The three Arcanist archetypes are [Classicalist](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/arcanist/classicalist.md), [Occultist](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/arcanist/occultist.md), and [Taskmage](https://github.com/morganmayday/tayen-core/blob/main/archetypes/arcanist/taskmage.md).

#### Spells
A first-level arcanist gains access to the spells for the skills they have ranks in. Each spell has 4 ranks, corresponding to the ranks of training--as an arcanist's skills progress, they can access spells of higher power.

To cast a spell, an arcanist declares the spell they're casting, the targets, and the desired outcome. They spend pips off their Spin Dice according to the spell's cost, broken up as they choose, and begin casting. At the end of the casting time, all rolls necessary to resolve the spell are made.

If an arcanist takes damage during the cast time, they must roll Endure (Difficulty 5 + the damage taken) or lose the spell and the Spin spent.

If an arcanist needs more Spin to cast a spell, they can announce that they are willing to _push their limits._ They take one Stress, and receive a temporary Spin Die that can only be used to pay for this spell and expires after any use.
