### Triage Problem
A first-level taskmage that enters a conflict can immediately ask the Spinner one of the following questions, and spend 3 spin up to twice to ask additional questions.

-- What is the most dangerous threat here?
-- What is the most immediate threat here?
-- How could I most efficiently make the situation worse for me and my allies?

### Practical Dispel
A n-level taskmage that uses Exert Will to end a magical effect can roll and add an Action Die to add to the Exert Will check. If they succeed, they replenish up to that Action Die's result of spin.
