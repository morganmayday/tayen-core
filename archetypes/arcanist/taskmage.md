#### Triage Problem
A first-level taskmage that enters a conflict can immediately ask the Spinner one of the following questions, and spend 3 spin up to twice to ask additional questions.

-- What is the most dangerous threat here?

-- What is the most immediate threat here?

-- How could I most efficiently make the situation worse for me and my allies?

#### Seventh Sense
A second-level taskmage can, at the start of their turn as a free action, begin concentrating, opening their seventh sense. While concentrating, they are alerted to the presence of any magic within about 30ft of them, as well as its kind (fulcry, rectory, or revery). They gain a +2 focus bonus to Evade against any magical attacks that pass within that range, and know when a spell starts being cast within that range.

If their concentration is broken, they take 1 Stress and can't open their seventh sense again until they have Rested. If they dismiss the effect, there is no penalty.

#### Practical Dispel
A third-level taskmage that uses Exert Will to end a magical effect can roll and add an Action Die to add to the Exert Will check. If they succeed, they replenish up to that Action Die's result of spin.
