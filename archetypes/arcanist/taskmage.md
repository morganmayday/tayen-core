#### Triage Problem
A first-level taskmage that enters a conflict can immediately ask the Spinner one of the following questions, and spend 3 spin up to twice to ask additional questions.

-- What is the most dangerous threat here?

-- What is the most immediate threat here?

-- How could I most efficiently make the situation worse for me and my allies?

#### Sixth Sense
A second-level taskmage can, at the start of their turn as a free action, begin concentrating, opening their sixth sense, their _ware_. While concentrating, they receive a +2 focus bonus on Read Someone and Evade.

If their concentration is broken, they take 1 Stress and can't open their ware again until they have Rested. If they dismiss the effect, there is no penalty.

#### Practical Dispel
A third-level taskmage that uses Exert Will to end a magical effect can roll and add an Action Die to add to the Exert Will check. If they succeed, they replenish up to that Action Die's result of spin.
