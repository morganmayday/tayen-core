### Classical Training
A first-level classicalist is, for the purposes of spells known, considered to have at least one rank in any three of their choice of Hit Hard, Move, Command, Ear to the Ground, and Read Someone. If they acquire a rank in one of their chosen skills, they may re-choose, as appropriate.

### Information Literacy
A second-level classicalist has been taught the basics of how to track down information. +2 education bonus to Research (or maybe to Ear to the Ground? prolly not. this brought to you by my library puts out classes on info lit that teach you some basics of how to do research and filter out false info)
