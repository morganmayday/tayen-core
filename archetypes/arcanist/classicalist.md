#### Classical Training
A first-level classicalist is, for the purposes of spells known, considered to have at least one rank in any three of their choice of Hit Hard, Move, Command, Ear to the Ground, and Read Someone. If they acquire a rank in one of their chosen skills, they may re-choose, as appropriate.

#### Veya Fluency
A first-level classicalist is considered fluent in Veya, in addition to Trade and their chosen language.

#### Seventh Sense

A second-level classicalist can, at the start of their turn as a free action, begin concentrating, opening their seventh sense, their _yse_. While concentrating, they are alerted to the presence of any magic within about 30ft of them, as well as its kind (fulcry, rectory, or revery). They gain a +2 focus bonus to Evade against any magical attacks that pass within that range, and know when a spell starts being cast within that range.

If their concentration is broken, they take 1 Stress and can't open their yse again until they have Rested. If they dismiss the effect, there is no penalty.
