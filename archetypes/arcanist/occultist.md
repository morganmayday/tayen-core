### Occult Readings
A first-level occultist, when they first encounter a magical or otherwise supernatural phenomenon, rolls to _recall occult lore_ about it. They can ask an additional question when they do this, even if they fail the check.

Additionally, an occultist who _recalls occult lore_ can also choose to ask the following free question of the Spinner. Doing so will not necessarily have positive effects, but it may make interesting things happen.

-- What was the nightmare I first met this thing in?
