### The Arcanist

> fluff here

The Arcanist has *three* Action Dice and *four* Spin Dice, which are *d6,* gaining one Spin Die at each odd-numbered level. Their Grit Die is a *d6* and their Stress Die is a *d10*. Their Health per level is 6 + Build.

An Arcanist of third level or higher is qualified for the in-universe title of Arcanist. An Arcanist of fifth level or higher has reached international acclaim; while they aren't a household name, anyone who knows anything about their specialties will know of them. An Arcanist of seventh level or higher has reached intersomnial acclaim, and is qualified for a Master's seat at the Gilded Tower if one is available.
