#### Money
Tayen has a variety of currencies, with silver being the "gold standard" most places. It does not, however, track individual currency for player characters as a base rule.

Instead, each player character has [ FLAG: WORKING NAME ] _credit,_ a measure of their ability to successfully pay for things. Your credit begins at 3. Reneging on a deal, purchasing a tool, consumable, or other major expenditures might reduce your credit. Delivering on a deal above-and-beyond the call of duty, being paid for a job, or selling a major item might increase your credit. 

When using Manipulate or another skill to wine, dine, or bribe someone, you can spend credit like Charisma to fudge failures or increase successes.

#### Tools
Each character begins play with three _tools._

Each tool is keyed to a skill it benefits. Weapons tend to be a bonus to Hit Hard and/or Strike First and armour tends to be a bonus to Evade--this may seem counterintuitive to those envisioning how heavy armour might work, but Evade is an umbrella covering "not getting hit." Ideally, you aren't getting hit, your armour is.

A tool can grant one of the following:

-- +3 to one skill, no penalties.

-- +2 to one skill and +1 to another, no penalties.

-- +5 to one skill, -2 to another, -1 to an ability you have at least one point in. [ FLAGGED FOR BALANCE TESTING ]
