Wounds are one of the ways a character can suffer long-term damage. They can affect Conviction or Health, depending on the injury.

Each Wound has a value, usually from 1 to 3, reducing your Conviction or Health cap. Taking a Full Rest and receiving medical attention during it can reduce one Wound value by 1, potentially eliminating it.

Wounds are assigned by the Spinner on a case-by-case basis. Usually, that's when you lose significant amounts of Health or Conviction.
