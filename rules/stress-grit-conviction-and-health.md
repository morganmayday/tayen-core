Each character has a Stress Die, a Grit Die, Health, and Convictions.

#### Stress Die
Each character's Stress Die sits at 1 until they become more Stressed. When their Stress Die overflows, they suffer a complete breakdown.

Taking the Full Rest intrigue action eliminates some of your Stress.

#### Grit Die
Each character's Grit Die starts at its highest number and goes down when their Conviction or Health is successfully attacked. When you run out of Grit, successful attacks directly damage your Conviction and Health.

Taking the Rest intrigue actions can replenish Grit.

#### Health
Each character's Health is a measure of their physical health. It increases marginally per level and is class-based. Physical attacks on you usually damage your Health, if you're out of Grit.

When you run out of Health, you're fucked.

Taking the Rest intrigue actions can replenish Health.

#### Conviction
Each character's Conviction is a measure of their mental fortitude and idealism. It starts at 8 and increases based on your Exert Will. Mental attacks on you usually damage your Conviction, if you're out of Grit.

When you run out of Conviction, you're fucked.

Taking the Rest intrigue actions can replenish Conviction.
