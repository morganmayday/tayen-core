### Dice
Tayen expects each player to have at _least_ the following: 

-- 2d8, for skill rolls.

-- 3d6, for Action Dice at 1st level. More dice are required at higher levels.

-- 3d6 more, for Banners and Mavens, or 4d6 more, for Arcanists, to track special resources at 1st level. More dice are required at higher levels.

-- A Stress Die (d10 for Arcanist, d8 for Banner, d6 for Maven) and a Grit Die (d6 for Arcanist, d10 for Banner, d8 for Maven).

These dice are used in three primary ways. 

#### Countdown
A die that is _ticked down_ or _ticked up_ isn't rollable. Stress Dice and Grit Dice are the primary examples: you lose Grit, and gain Stress. If you lose all of your Grit or overflow your Stress, bad things happen.
