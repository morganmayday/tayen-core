### Dice
Tayen expects each player to have at _least_ the following: 

-- 2d8, for skill rolls.

-- 3d6, for Action Dice at 1st level. More dice are required at higher levels.

-- 3d6 more, for Banners and Mavens, or 4d6 more, for Arcanists, to track special resources at 1st level. More dice are required at higher levels.

-- A Stress Die (d10 for Arcanist, d8 for Banner, d6 for Maven) and a Grit Die (d6 for Arcanist, d10 for Banner, d8 for Maven).

These dice are used in three primary ways. 

#### Countdown
A die that is _ticked down_ or _ticked up_ isn't rollable. Stress Dice and Grit Dice are the primary examples: you lose Grit, and gain Stress. If you lose all of your Grit or overflow your Stress, bad things happen.

#### Cash In
A die that is _cashed in_ has a flat effect that requires the die to be spent as a resource. Sometimes, the effect will be stronger based on the die's value, but this is the exception, not the rule. You can cash in a die that you've ticked down or up.

#### Roll
A die that is _rolled_ has a variable effect based on the result after the roll. Most of the time, a rolled die is spent when it's rolled, but there are some exceptions, like the 2d8 you use for skill rolls. A die that's ticked down or up and rolled is capped at the previous value--if a d6 was ticked down to 4, and you rolled a 5 or 6 on it, that would be considered a 4.

### Not Enough & Digital Dice

While Tayen expects you to have a certain number of physical dice, sometimes that isn't reasonable. If you have one of each, or access to a digital dice roller, you can use a spreadsheet, document, or pen and paper to track your dice numbers.
