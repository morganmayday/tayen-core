#### Levels
Each character begins at first level. The Spinner will plan, generally, three to five levelups over the course of a campaign, marked at major plot developments--I structure my games in three acts, each of which generally has one to two levels each.

#### Skills
Each character begins with the two primary skills of their archetype, two other skills determined by their archetype, and two skills of their choice. They have one rank in each of them. Each rank provides a +2 bonus on those checks.

When a character levels up, they get two ranks to assign as they will, though not above the cap. At first level, you can have one rank in any given skill, at second, two, at fourth, three, at sixth, four, and at eighth, five.

#### Attributes
Each character has Build, Dexterity, Intuition, Knowledge, and Charisma. These statistics don't inherently add to related checks, but instead allow a measure of leeway--if you fail a check pertaining to a given attribute, you can temporarily spend one point of that attribute for a +5 bonus, potentially turning a failure into a success. You can do this any number of times per check.

When you salvage, you can't go above the lowest degree of success for the check. If you salvage an 11, and you would succeed at a 12 and have an extra effect at 15, you do not get the 15. If you salvage in a contest, you can only beat your opponent's result by 1.

If you salvage in a contest, and succeed, your opponent can then salvage, and you can salvage back, et cetera.

At first level, they allocate either 2/2/0/0/0 or 2/1/1/0/0 amongst those attributes. At third, fifth, and seventh level, they gain an additional point to allocate as they choose.

Attributes reset to their usual values after a Rest.

#### Traits
Every character begins with a *trait.* At each level, you can either pick a new trait or improve an existing trait.

You can only have three traits. You can, when you level up, swap out an _unimproved_ trait for another unimproved trait, but any other retraining has to be cleared with the Spinner.
