#### Levels
Each character begins at first level. The Spinner will plan, generally, three to five levelups over the course of a campaign, marked at major plot developments--I structure my games in three acts, each of which generally has one to two levels each.

#### Skills
Each character begins with the two primary skills of their archetype, two other skills determined by their archetype, and two skills of their choice. They have one rank in each of them. Each rank provides a +2 bonus on those checks.

When a character levels up, they get two ranks to assign as they will, though not above the cap. At first level, you can have one rank in any given skill, at second, two, at fourth, three, at sixth, four, and at eighth, five.

#### Abilities
Each character has Build, Dexterity, Intuition, Knowledge, and Charisma. These statistics don't inherently add to related checks, but instead allow a measure of leeway--if you fail a check pertaining to a given ability, you can temporarily spend one point of that ability for a +5 bonus, potentially turning a failure into a success. You can only do this once per check.

At first level, they allocate either 2/2/0/0/0 or 2/1/1/0/0 amongst those abilities. At third, fifth, and seventh level, they gain an additional point to allocate as they choose.

#### Traits
Every character begins with a *trait.* At each level, you can either pick a new trait or improve an existing trait.

You can only have three traits. You can, when you level up, swap out an _unimproved_ trait for another unimproved trait, but any other retraining has to be cleared with the Spinner.
