#### Acquire Gear
You seek out a tool or consumable in the market you're in. Roll Ear to the Ground. On a failure, you can still find it, but it is inordinately expensive. The Spinner may say that something isn't locatable in a market--for example, in a small-town market, you won't be able to find the severed head of a king. The Spinner tells you this before you roll.

For a *common consumable,* the DC is 7. Common consumables include first aid supplies, ammunition, trail bars, lockpicks, and the like.
