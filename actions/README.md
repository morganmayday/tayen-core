#### Actions
On your turn, you have either one major action or two minor actions. You can take as many different free actions as you want.

#### Scales
Tayen operates on three timescales.

If you want to take an action from a shorter timescale in a longer timescale, you can! It becomes the next shorter type of action--full-round becomes major becomes minor becomes free. If something has a specific activation time listed, like "one minute", it doesn't change. Sometimes this won't make sense. The Spinner has final say.

#### Conflict Scale
Conflict scale is bullet time. Each major action is about five seconds. Conflict scale is used for debates, duels, raids, and the like--things where hair-trigger action-reaction is necessary.

In conflict scale, order of operations can matter a lot. As a rule of thumb, the person initiating the conflict goes first, then their allies, then their enemies. If there isn't a specific initiator, or both sides are aware and prepared, then Strike First checks are used to decide order.

#### Event Scale
Event scale is a more extended scale. Each major action is about half an hour. Event scale is used for parties, festivals, and the like--things where the tasks are longer and more ambiguous.

#### Intrigue Scale
Intrigue scale is a significantly extended scale. Each major action is about five days. Intrigue scale is used for resting up, establishing contacts, doing extended research, crafting or procuring odd items, travelling, and the like--things where the tasks often involve several, smaller tasks.
