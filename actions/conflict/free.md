#### Extra Action
By cashing in an Action Die, you can take a free, additional minor or major action. You can only do this once per turn and only in conflict scale.

#### Share Information
You can share information with your allies who can hear you as a free action. The downside of this is that doing so will let _anyone else_ who can hear you know that information as well.
