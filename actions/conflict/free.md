#### Extra Action
By cashing in an Action Die, you can take a free, additional minor or major action. You can only do this once per turn and only in conflict scale.

#### Share Information
You can share information with your allies who can hear you as a free action. The downside of this is that doing so will let _anyone else_ who can hear you know that information as well.

#### Fall
If you're in the air, unsupported, and not flying, you must take this free action at the beginning of each round. You fall up to 500ft straight down, stopping only when you collide with an object, and when you collide with an object, take 1 damage for each 20ft you've fallen in this scene, including previous rounds, up to 30 damage.
