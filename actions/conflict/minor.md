You move up to 30ft, usually on foot. You can roll Move to move further, and can use Move instead of Evade during the movement.

On a 12+, you move up to 10ft further. On a 17+, you move up to 20ft further instead.

#### Go on the Defensive
You grant yourself a +2 focus bonus to Evade, Endure, and Exert Will until the start of your next turn.

#### Read a Situation
You roll Ear to the Ground, and ask the Spinner a question. On a 12+, you may ask two, on a 17+, you may ask three instead.

-- What is the context I can glean for this situation?

-- Who or what should I have an eye on here?

-- Who is dealing from the biggest position of strength here?

-- What is an opening here that I haven't seen?

#### Read Intent
You roll Read Someone, targeting someone you've observed for at least one turn. They contest your Read Someone with a Manipulate roll. 

If you lose the contest, they ask one of the following about you, and you ask one of the following about them. If you tie the contest, you ask one of the following about them. If you win the contest, you ask two of the following about them.
