#### Move
You move up to 30ft, usually on foot. You can roll Move to move further, and can use Move instead of Evade during the movement.

On a 12+, you move up to 10ft further. On a 17+, you move up to 20ft further instead.

#### Go on the Defensive
You grant yourself a +2 focus bonus to Evade, Endure, and Exert Will until the start of your next turn.
