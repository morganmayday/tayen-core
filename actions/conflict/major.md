#### Go on the Offensive
You choose another creature in the scene to target with one of the following skills.

-- Hit Hard, opposed by Evade.

-- Strike First, opposed by Strike First.

-- Manipulate, opposed by Read Someone.

-- Command, opposed by Exert Will.

You deal damage based on by how far you beat them in the contest, on a 1-for-1 basis. Damage affects Grit first, then overflows into Conviction or Health as appropriate.

You must be in an appropriate range--for example, to Hit Hard with a melee weapon, you must be in melee; to Hit Hard with a rhetorical argument, your target must be able to hear you.

> Sidebar: Manipulate and Command Offensives\
> Generally, you use Manipulate when you don't want your target to realize you're manipulating them, and Command when you're relying not necessarily on force but on _authority._\
> Hit Hard and Strike First are not limited to physical efforts! In a social context, they are both incredibly useful skills to use--Strike First might let you preempt a rival's point, and Hit Hard would let you use pure overwhelming rhetorical force. The setting-appropriate version of "L + ratio + no bitches + here's a picture of your house from when I was visiting your mother last night" would be a Hit Hard check.

#### Help
You aid an ally with a skill check. You must have a rank in the skill they're rolling to Help. 

If you have one rank, you grant a +2 help bonus. If you have two or more, you grant +4 instead.
