#### Rest
You take a one-day rest period, doing little strenuous work, doing your best to recover. You regain half your Grit and half your Health and Conviction (before Wounds), rounding up each time.

#### Create Stash
You create a stash that you can later retrieve gear from with the Retrieve Gear minor event action. Each stash can contain up to three tools, in addition to up to eight consumables.
