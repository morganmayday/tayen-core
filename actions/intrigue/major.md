#### Full Rest
You take a full rest period, doing little strenuous work, doing your best to recover, for a full five days. You regain your Grit, all your Health and Conviction (though not beyond your Wounds), and clear half your Stress, rounding up.

### Socialize
You just kinda hang out with a party member. Pick a skill for each other. You both get a consumable for that skill, which either has a +3 bonus, or has a +2 use and a +1 use. This bonus expires at the end of your next Intrigue action.
