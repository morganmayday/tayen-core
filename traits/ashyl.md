You have been touched by the dragons that sleep beneath the world, their magic suffusing and infusing you with power.

When you take this trait, choose one of the Ashen Metals (lead, iron, copper, silver, gold). You have scales that resemble that metal, and can briefly invoke draconic power. When you take damage that reduces you to 0 Grit, you can immediately cash in _all_ of your remaining Action Dice, regaining 1 Grit per die lost, which is then depleted before any overflow affects Health or Conviction.

II: You've investigated the writings of the past and learned Ashen. You also gain Historical Lore as a lore specialty.

III: When you take damage of an Ashen type (cold, mental, spectral, thunder, or lucent), you can negate _all_ past the first point of damage. You can do this only once before you Rest.

IV: When you directly inflict damage of any type, you can change it to your Ashen type.
