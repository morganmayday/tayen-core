You have been touched by the dragons that sleep beneath the world, their magic suffusing and infusing you with power.

When you take this trait, choose one of the Ashen Metals (lead, iron, copper, silver, gold). You have scales that resemble that metal, and can briefly invoke draconic power. When you take damage that reduces you to 0 Grit, you can immediately cash in _all_ of your remaining Action Dice, regaining 1 Grit per die lost.
