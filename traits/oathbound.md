You have sworn yourself to a liegelord. 

Your liegelord is responsible for your bread, bed, and head. They will pay for your food and lodging, within reason, and any criminal grievances about you must be brought to your liegelord, who then chooses punishment as is fitting. You are, however, oathbound to protect their reputation and follow their orders.

II: You have distinguished yourself. Your liegelord expects more from you, but gives you more leeway in executing their orders, and is more willing to grant favours to you.

III: You have distinguished yourself a worrying amount. Your liegelord expects the best from you. Other liegelords look to poach you from their service, or assassinate you.

IV: You are freed from your liegelord's service. Pick one:

-- Retrain all four trait points you have put into this trait, and gain another free trait point. You cannot take this trait again.

-- You are a liegelord in your own right. You have, at minimum, one man-at-arms who plays the part of your bodyguard, and can recruit more.
