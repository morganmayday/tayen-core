You have sworn yourself to a liegelord. 

Your liegelord is responsible for your bread, bed, and head. They will pay for your food and lodging, within reason, and any criminal grievances about you must be brought to your liegelord, who then chooses punishment as is fitting. You are, however, oathbound to protect their reputation and follow their orders.

II: You have distinguished yourself. Your liegelord expects more from you, but gives you more leeway in executing their orders, and is more willing to grant favours to you.

III: You have distinguished yourself a worrying amount. Your liegelord expects more from you, and 

IV: You are freed from your patron's service; this may be a result of their death or permission, or you leaving or replacing them.
