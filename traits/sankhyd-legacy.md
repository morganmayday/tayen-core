FLAGGED: TABBED FOR REMOVAL

You are one of the shifting folk, inducted into mystic traditions of form and change.

When you take this trait, choose a small animal--mice, cats, corvids, and foxes are all fairly common examples.

As a conflict minor action, you can shift into or out of your animal form. Anything you're wearing or carrying shifts with you, melding into your form. While in your animal form, you can't speak, can't use class features or other abilities, but have a +2 to Evade, Track Down, and Ear to the Ground, as well as two other skills agreed upon with the Spinner to be appropriate to your alternate form.

II: You can still speak in your alternate form, and you get the +2 to Track Down in sehen form, as your senses are enhanced.

III: You can shift as a free action in conflict. Additionally, the bonuses improve to +4.

IV: You can still use features and abilities while in your animal form.
